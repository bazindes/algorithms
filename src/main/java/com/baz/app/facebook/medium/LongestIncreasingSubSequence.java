     * Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest increasing subsequence.
     *
     * Example:
     *
     * Input: [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
     * Output: 4
     * Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4.
     * Note:
     *
     * There may be more than one LIS combination, it is only necessary for you to return the length.
     * Your algorithm should run in O(n2) complexity.
     * Follow up: Could you improve it to O(n log n) time complexity?
