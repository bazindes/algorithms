    /**
     * Implement atoi which converts a string to an integer.
     *
     * The function first discards as many whitespace characters as necessary until the first non-whitespace character is found.
     * Then, starting from this character, takes an optional initial plus or minus sign followed by as many numerical digits as possible,
     * and interprets them as a numerical value.
     *
     * The string can contain additional characters after those that form the integral number,
     * which are ignored and have no effect on the behavior of this function.
     *
     * If the first sequence of non-whitespace characters in str is not a valid integral number,
     * or if no such sequence exists because either str is empty or it contains only whitespace characters, no conversion is performed.
     *
     * If no valid conversion could be performed, a zero value is returned.
     *
     * Note:
     * Only the space character ' ' is considered as whitespace character.
     * Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−231,  231 − 1].
     * If the numerical value is out of the range of representable values, INT_MAX (231 − 1) or INT_MIN (−231) is returned.
     * Example 1:
     * Input: "42"
     * Output: 42
     * Example 2:
     * Input: "   -42"
     * Output: -42
     * Explanation: The first non-whitespace character is '-', which is the minus sign.
     *              Then take as many numerical digits as possible, which gets 42.
     * Example 3:
     * Input: "4193 with words"
     * Output: 4193
     * Explanation: Conversion stops at digit '3' as the next character is not a numerical digit.
     * Example 4:
     * Input: "words and 987"
     * Output: 0
     * Explanation: The first non-whitespace character is 'w', which is not a numerical
     *              digit or a +/- sign. Therefore no valid conversion could be performed.
     * Example 5:
     * Input: "-91283472332"
     * Output: -2147483648
     * Explanation: The number "-91283472332" is out of the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
     *              Thefore INT_MIN (−231) is returned.
